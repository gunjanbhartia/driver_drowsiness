# driver_drowsiness
In this Python project, I aim to create a drowsiness detection system to help prevent accidents caused by sleepy driving, especially during long-distance journeys. Drowsy driving poses a serious risk, leading to numerous accidents. This system will use OpenCV and Keras to detect signs of drowsiness and provide timely alerts, helping keep drivers safe.

Using OpenCV for computer vision, I will analyze real-time video input from a camera in the vehicle. The system will monitor key facial features like eyes and mouth to detect patterns of drowsiness, such as prolonged eye closure or yawning.

I will train a deep learning model using Keras, employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on a dataset containing images of both awake and drowsy states. The model will learn to identify signs of drowsiness by analyzing facial features.

During operation, the system will continuously analyze the video stream and, if signs of drowsiness are detected, it will trigger an alert (e.g., an alarm or a warning message).

This drowsiness detection system aims to reduce the risk of accidents caused by drowsy driving, enhancing road safety by alerting drivers when their attention begins to slip.
